GETTING WEB SERVICES TO WORK

1.  Download Eclipse JavaEE--it has the Tomcat server stuff built-in as well as all the internal workings to set up web service stuff
2.  Import the code into the Eclipse workspace
3.  If it's not included, download the Java DB Connecter and add it to the project as well as the project's build path:   http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
4.  Right click on the 'ProjectWS.java' file and select 'Web Services -> Create Web Services'
5.  On the resulting popup menu, move both sliders to the top, check the Publish and Monitor the Web Service boxes, and click Finish
6.  Choose which web services to test!
